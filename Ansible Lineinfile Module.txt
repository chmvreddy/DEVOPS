The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible only. Therefore, prepare the required playbook to complete this task. Find more details about the task below.


a.We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible on jump host. Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible on jump host itself.

b.Using the playbook install httpd web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.

c.Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:
  This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

d.Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:
  Welcome to Nautilus Group!

Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.

e.The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

f.The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0755 on all app servers.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.
